                <div class="section-title">E/ME 105 Design for the Developing World</div>
		    <div class="section-content">
                        To learn how a product for the rural poor should be developed, we actually build that product - at least to the prototype stage. By doing this for one application, students learn how to build other products because the processes at the highest level are similar. This class was suggested by the Student Club, “Engineers for a Sustainable World” (ESW). With their help, a modification of my Product Design Class was accomplished. They have continued as my partner in the design and execution of this class. The idea was to re-orient the curricula to target building products for the 1 billion+ people in the world who earn less than the equivalent of a dollar a day. In addition to an extreme focus on cost and usefulness, we tried to design products that not only were environmentally sustainable but also economically viable. These products would solve a need so powerful that sufficient funds could be generated to build a sustainable business by entrepreneurs in the rural community. We decided to initially concentrate on Guatemala, benefiting from the strong Guatemalan community in LA. The Course moved in (2010) to Kerala, India and subsequently returned home to LA as Design for Freedom from Disability.<br>
			<br>
			The course included cases, my lectures on product design, and guest experts. All lectures were video teleconferenced between campuses. Each team had Guatemalan students (then Indian students) as members. Thus, we are able to obtain ground truth to each Team’s ideas on a continuous basis. The Art Center School of Design in Pasadena has also been a close partner. We made a pre-trip to our partner country in the summer to research problems to address in the Fall class.<br>
			<br>
                        The most successful spin-out from the class to date is the wheelchair project. Here the students cannibalized bicycles to make a wheelchair. The result was low cost and easy repairability and ergonomic design. From this effort came a non-profit: <a href="http://www.intelligentmobility.org/" target="_blank">Intelligent Mobility International.</a> Before and after graduating Caltech students have raised funds, hired employees in Guatemala, and incorporated. Although the numbers are still small, over 200 wheelchairs are being built as this is written in Guatemala by Guatemalans. The design has been modified several times in E/ME classes as new information on its use is obtained. The Team has won several awards including a “Breakthrough Award” from Popular Mechanics. At the meeting last month of the National Collegiate Innovators and Inventors Association (NCIIA), they exhibited their latest version wheelchair at an exhibit in the Smithsonian. They placed second in a Social Ventures LA competition run earlier this year out of many entries. There are other students doing independent study, working in the area of clean water – both solar distillation and point-of-use filtration.<br>

		    In 2017 six papers were written on:
		</div>
		<div class="section-content">
		<ul>
		    <li>
		    	<p class="text-bold">The Doorbuster 2017: An Automatic Door Opener for people in wheelchairs</p>
			<span class="text-italic">Manasa Ashok, Sumana Mahata, Meera Ramakrishnan, Harry Teng, Sherrie Yang</span><br>
			<p>Introduction: The process of opening rolling through doors is a challenge for wheelchair uses. An automatic door opener was designed to be cost effective, intuitive, and helpful in getting through the front door of a home.</p>

		        <p class="text-bold">Over Braked – new braking systems for wheelchairs</p>
			<span class="text-italic">Cole Allen, Lucy Chen, Michael Jenson, Sheila Murthy, Alissa Wang</span><br>
			<p>Introduction: Standard brakes for solid rubber wheels work well enough on new wheels but are much less effective on worn tires. This is, of course, highly dangerous for wheelchair users, who may find their chairs shifting or even tipping backwards as they perform their daily transfers in and out of the wheelchair. Our solution is a brake that engages with the floor like a kickstand instead of the wheels. This avoids wear effects.</p>

		        <p class="text-bold">Pressure Sore Detection System: Motivation, Design, and Fabrication</p>
			<span class="text-italic">Nasser Al-Rayes, Ishwar Subramanian</span><br>
			<p>Introduction: Pressure sores are still far too common in the medical world, costing the United States $11 billion each year in patient treatment. For wheelchair patients we developed a series of sensors that sit between the wheelchair upholstery and wheelchair cushion. These sensors will be adjustable depending on the person’s build to ensure our product acts as a one-size-fits-all. This would be the basis for a system which mitigates the effect of pressure over a period of time.</p>

			<span class="text-italic">Talia Minear</span><br>
			<p>Introduction: Extensions to adapt existing Xbox controllers for avid gamers with limited mobility were designed and built. This will help build cognitive skills, physical strength, and self-confidence. Commercial Xbox buttons are small and tightly mapped on the controller, which is not designed for fine motor skills and not for the one-handed. Our kit of clip-on additions to the Xbox extend the joysticks and the top trigger buttons. They are easily attached to and removed from the controller to enable ease of putting on and removal. The result is that these tasks can be preformed without outside help.</p>

			<span class="text-italic">Bailey Da Costa, Vasant Iyer, Mathew Simon, Surya Sundararajan</span><br>
			<p>Introduction: Pushing a wheelchair places a heavy burden on attendants and caregivers; in the long term, caregivers who push wheelchairs often accumulate a number of chronic injuries. Our goal is to create a motorized assist device that can help a caregiver push a collapsible wheelchair, preventing injuries from repetitive stress. Our product is designed to help in a variety of conditions (terrain, inclines, etc.) and feel natural both to the caregiver and the person in the wheelchair.</p>

		        <p class="text-bold">Axis</p>
			<span class="text-italic">Mary Boyajian, Elliott Davis, Bogdan Dimitriu, Sherrie Yang</span><br>
			<p>Introduction: The issue of transfer from a wheelchair to a regular chair or to a driver’s seat of a car is significant. Although boards to slide on are a possible solution, present devices are heavy and bulky. We designed a board that is light (carbon fiber), foldable, strong and compact and was shown to be effective in moving the user into the driver’s seat.</p>

		    <li>
		        <p class="text-bold">Intelligent Cane- Advancement of Cane Technology (ACT)</p>
			<span class="text-italic">Sandra Liu, Maegan Tucker</span><br>
			<p>Introduction: The work resulted in a prototype cane which was sensitive to tilt - giving a sensory signal (vibration) when not in proper orientation as the gait progressed. This was tested and approved at our partner institution- Rancho los Amigos. Falls by the elderly can be a great risk for disability.</p>

		        <p class="text-bold">Clunk and Swoosh Assistive wheelchair Anti-tippers</p>
			<span class="text-italic">Ellen Chuan , Cindy Huang, Julia Xia</span><br>
			<p>Introduction: The act of propelling a manual wheelchair can be quite hard on the body and can easily lead to shoulder injuries. A next-generation wheelchair power assist would allow wheelchair users to maintain the same level of mobility while decreasing the required physical exertion. The object was to allow the chair to “glide” for longer, cutting the number of times a user would need to push drastically.</p>
