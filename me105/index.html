			<span class="text-italic">Manasa Ashok, Sumana Mahata, Meera Ramakrishnan, Harry Teng, Sherrie Yang</span><br>
			<p>The process of opening rolling through doors is a challenge for wheelchair uses. An automatic door opener was designed to be cost effective, intuitive, and helpful in getting through the front door of a home.</p>

			<span class="text-italic">Cole Allen, Lucy Chen, Michael Jenson, Sheila Murthy, Alissa Wang</span><br>
			<p>Standard brakes for solid rubber wheels work well enough on new wheels but are much less effective on worn tires. This is, of course, highly dangerous for wheelchair users, who may find their chairs shifting or even tipping backwards as they perform their daily transfers in and out of the wheelchair. Our solution is a brake that engages with the floor like a kickstand instead of the wheels. This avoids wear effects.</p>

		        <p class="text-bold">Pressure Sore Detection System: Motivation, Design, and Fabrication</p>
			<span class="text-italic">Nasser Al-Rayes, Ishwar Subramanian</span><br>
			<p>Pressure sores are still far too common in the medical world, costing the United States $11 billion each year in patient treatment. For wheelchair patients we developed a series of sensors that sit between the wheelchair upholstery and wheelchair cushion. These sensors will be adjustable depending on the person’s build to ensure our product acts as a one-size-fits-all. This would be the basis for a system which mitigates the effect of pressure over a period of time.</p>

			<span class="text-italic">Talia Minear</span><br>
			<p>Extensions to adapt existing Xbox controllers for avid gamers with limited mobility were designed and built. This will help build cognitive skills, physical strength, and self-confidence. Commercial Xbox buttons are small and tightly mapped on the controller, which is not designed for fine motor skills and not for the one-handed. Our kit of clip-on additions to the Xbox extend the joysticks and the top trigger buttons. They are easily attached to and removed from the controller to enable ease of putting on and removal. The result is that these tasks can be preformed without outside help.</p>

			<span class="text-italic">Bailey Da Costa, Vasant Iyer, Mathew Simon, Surya Sundararajan</span><br>
			<p>Pushing a wheelchair places a heavy burden on attendants and caregivers; in the long term, caregivers who push wheelchairs often accumulate a number of chronic injuries. Our goal is to create a motorized assist device that can help a caregiver push a collapsible wheelchair, preventing injuries from repetitive stress. Our product is designed to help in a variety of conditions (terrain, inclines, etc.) and feel natural both to the caregiver and the person in the wheelchair.</p>

			<p>The issue of transfer from a wheelchair to a regular chair or to a driver’s seat of a car is significant. Although boards to slide on are a possible solution, present devices are heavy and bulky. We designed a board that is light (carbon fiber), foldable, strong and compact and was shown to be effective in moving the user into the driver’s seat.</p>

		    <li>
		        <p class="text-bold">Intelligent Cane- Advancement of Cane Technology (ACT)</p>
			<span class="text-italic">Sandra Liu, Maegan Tucker</span><br>
			<p>The work resulted in a prototype cane which was sensitive to tilt - giving a sensory signal (vibration) when not in proper orientation as the gait progressed. This was tested and approved at our partner institution- Rancho los Amigos. Falls by the elderly can be a great risk for disability.</p>

		        <p class="text-bold">Clunk and Swoosh Assistive wheelchair Anti-tippers</p>
			<span class="text-italic">Ellen Chuan , Cindy Huang, Julia Xia</span><br>
			<p>The act of propelling a manual wheelchair can be quite hard on the body and can easily lead to shoulder injuries. A next-generation wheelchair power assist would allow wheelchair users to maintain the same level of mobility while decreasing the required physical exertion. The object was to allow the chair to “glide” for longer, cutting the number of times a user would need to push drastically.</p>
