		<div class="section-title">E/ME 103: Management of Technology</div>
		<div class="section-content">
		    This course was for students interested in learning how rapidly evolving technologies are harnessed to produce useful products, successful businesses and great research. The concept is to analytically predict what will happen in the next ~ 5 years.<br>
		    <br>
		    Students are confronted with real technical businesses with real challenges in the form of cases. Some of these cases are from Harvard Business School; some are written by myself and my TA collaborating with the protagonist. Through lectures they study how innovation takes place in businesses. These learnings are applied to a term project. The students can choose a technology they are interested in and learn how to make a defensible technical prediction. (Note I didn’t say a correct technical projection!). They learn how to determine if a market actually exists for the technology. Alternatively, they research a local company and try to discover the processes of technical innovation that occur within the company and how to critique same. Some of the results of these term papers have been startling in that the students have seen critical issues that have escaped the management of the companies they researched. I should say that in this as in all my classes, research (in addition to working the internet), is primarily done either face to face or through the phone by interviews with protagonists.<br>
		    <br>
                    A case has been written with Kent Kresa, and the TAs for the Class Dimitriy Kernasovskiy, on the aerospace Industry in the 90s - particularly Northrup in the early 90s when it was faced with the decision to grow or die.<br>
                    <br>
		    David Baltimore talks about biotech and how to improve the success rate of new companies. Rob Manning from JPL talks about managing technical people for the Mars Landing, Iqbal Quadir, and the President of the MIT Legatum Center lectures on Grameen Telecom and the power of technology to change people’s lives.  Henry Kressel talks about future Global Competitiveness in innovation. Bill Gross discusses management of technology in early stage companies.<br>
		    <br>
		    This class is also highly collaborative. The widely varied subjects reflect the diversity of personal interests of the student teams.<br>

			<span class="text-italic">Gavy Aggarwal, Jessica Choi, Abirami Kurinchi-Vendhan, Malavika Venkatesan</span><br>
			<p>Introduction: A large reason for VR’s past failures has been poor user experience resulting from technological limitations. An analysis was made of the current state of the technology - specifically focusing on head mounted displays in commercial markets. The state of control systems, machine learning, and sensor processing were also examined.</p>

			<p>Introduction: Three hypothesis were examined:
			<ul>
			    <li> Hypothesis #1<br>
				Machine learning can help human’s with the decision-making process. However, the final decision still needs to be made by a human. We found that in some cases the whole process could be made by a machine.
			    </li>
			    <li> Hypothesis #2<br>
				By utilizing machine learning, bad loan ratios can be lowered for large amount loans. We are convinced that machine learning can reduce the bad loan ratio.
			    </li>
			    <li> Hypothesis #3<br>
				Use of this technology by banking startups can be a threat for traditional banks in China. We feel this is true.

			<span class="text-italic">Hapreet Arora and Nikhil Gupta</span><br>
			<p>Introduction: Display technology has greatly changed in the past few decades and continues to rapidly evolve. Since the early years when Cathode Ray Tube technology dominated the television market, TV display technology has evolved from plasma, projector based, liquid crystal display, light-emitting diodes, and now to organic light emitting diode. We investigate the trade-off every consumer debates: price versus features. OLED dominates now broken up into Passive Matrix OLED and Active Matrix OLED, Quantum Dot displays and in the future Micro-LEDs. Despite this, LCD displays will still maintain a significant presence in the lower end displays.</p>

			<span class="text-italic">Bradley Silverman and Benjamin Laccetti</span><br>
			<p>Introduction: Currently the vast majority of pharmaceutical processes are done using batch manufacturing - unlike the use of continuous processes in the chemical industries which are more efficient, exhibit faster cycle times, and require smaller capital costs and plant footprints. We report on how this opportunity for pharmaceuticals can be exploited in the next ten years.</p>

			<p>Introduction: The growing use of headsets was the focus. It is believed that the technology required for these devices is currently ready for AR products to enter the enterprise market in the near future followed by the consumer market later on. Many companies have products in development. As prices drop, AR headsets will eventually succeed smartphones. We expect AR to be popular in the enterprise setting within the next 5 to 10 years, followed by a growth in the consumer market 5 to 10 years after that.</p>

			<p>Introduction: From biofuels, to pharmaceuticals, to specialty products, chemicals are predominantly made using synthetic, metal-based catalysts. Alternatively, Biocatalytic technologies can address some of the major disadvantages of this approach in the areas of specificity, selectivity and environmental impact. We studied industrial scale use, potential markets and the IP to project the trajectory of the technology over the next five years.</p>
