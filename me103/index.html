	    <div class="section-content">
		This course was for students interested in learning how rapidly evolving technologies are harnessed to produce useful products, successful businesses and great research.<br>
		<br>
		The concept is to analytically predict what will happen in the next ~ 5 years.<br>
		<br>
		The widely varied subjects reflect the diversity of personal interests of the Student Teams.<br>
		<br>
		The Final Papers are available upon request.<br>

		<div class="section-content">
		<ul>
		    <li>Occular Phototherapeutics - <p class="text-italic">Colin Cook, Anupama Lakshmanan, Aubrey Shapero</p> - Phototherapy devices packaged into contact and intraocular lenses can make Phototherapy useful for diabetic patients.</li>
		    <li>Battery Grid Energy Storage - <p class="text-italic">Kevin Shen, Zainab Al Saihati, Pooja Verma, Bismark Wong</p> - Importance of frequency regulation, grid reliability and backup power availability to financially justify large roll-outs.</li>
		    <li>Extracellular Vesicles for Drug Delivery - <p class="text-italic">Beatriz Atsavapranee, Ashwin Ram, Sherrie Yang</p> - Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a promising drug carrier to deliver therapeutic RNA, as they may have improved biocompatibility and delivery efficiency when compared to previous synthetic systems.</li>
		    <li>An Evaluation of Virtual Reality Technology - <p class="text-italic">Gavy Aggarwal, Jessica Choi, Abirami Kurinchi-Vendhan, Malavika Venkatesan</p> - A large reason for VR’s past failures has been poor user experience resulting from technological limitations. An analysis was made of the current state of the technology- specifically focusing on head mounted displays in commercial markets. The state of control systems, machine learning, and sensor processing were also examined.</li>
		    <li>Spatial Sensing Technologies for Autonomous Vehicles - <p class="text-italic">Junno Tseng, Will Whitney, and Arky Yang</p> - Spatial sensing technologies are one of the key roadblocks to the

success of autonomous vehicles. Investigated were (a) the state of the art of visual, radar, lidar and ultrasonic automotive sensors, (b) their criticality to the future of autonomous vehicles, and (c) their evolution in the next several years.</li>
		    <li>Application of Machine Learning to the Personal Loan Industry in China - <p class="text-italic">Jiajun Shi, Dong Liang, Yan (Echo) Wu, Hongnian Yu</p> - Three hypothesis were examined:
		    <ul>
			<li> Hypothesis #1<br>
			    Machine learning can help human’s with the decision-making process. However, the final decision still needs to be made by a human. We found that in some cases the whole process could be made by a machine.
			</li>
			<li> Hypothesis #2<br>
			    By utilizing machine learning, bad loan ratios can be lowered for large amount loans. We are convinced that machine learning can reduce the bad loan ratio.
			</li>
			<li> Hypothesis #3<br>
			    Use of this technology by banking startups can be a threat for traditional banks in China. We feel this is true.
