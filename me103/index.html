		E/ME 103 is for students interested in learning how rapidly evolving technologies are harnessed to produce useful products and successful businesses. Key issues will be elucidated in Lectures and through invited key scientific/business leaders as well as Harvard Business School Cases. The cases will be taken from various industries (financial services, semiconductor, medical devices, biotech, aerospace, etc.) The course is designed for students considering working in companies (any size including startup), consulting Careers, or perhaps eventually going to business school. It can also be useful in the choice of scientific projects to pursue.<br>
                <br>
		There are two options for a term project. Teams can choose to do an assessment of a technology and make projections about the future of this choice. The other option is to perform an innovative capabilities audit of a technology-focused company. You can choose any size firm - there are many in the Pasadena and Southern California area to allow for easier networking.<br>
                <br>
		Topics include technology as a growth agent, financial fundamentals, integration into other business processes, product life cycle, product development pipeline, learning curves, risk assessment, financial implications, technology trend methodologies (scenarios and projections), core competencies, portfolio management, motivation, rewards and recognition, outsourcing and joint ventures.<br>
