		This is a transition year for me! I am going to retirement and am getting used to it. I never was one for abrupt transitions!<br>
                <br>
		I am more active in the <a href="https://www.techcoastangels.com">Tech Coast Angels</a> which funds new start-ups. This is in addition to work with the <a href="https://laincubator.org">Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator</a> (LACI), the South Coast Botanical Gardens and the Chamber Orchestra of the South Bay. Others will be added!<br>

                We are traveling more to see family and friends.<br>
                <br>
		I would like to keep a presence on the campus even after this year. I have been on the Campus teaching and advising for 22 Years. I have taught a lot but I have learned considerably more from my students and colleagues. It has been particularly rewarding to meet and talk with former students who have gone on to great things and who are my friends.<br>

                So here is a few words on what has happened in the last 2 years for two courses I have taught:<br>
