                    The course will be taught again in Fall 2018. 

E/ME 103 is for students interested in learning how rapidly evolving technologies are harnessed to produce useful products and successful businesses and great research.

Distinguished Guest Lecturers share their experiences.

Last year Six papers were written on Occular Phototherapeutics, Renewable Energy on a Systems Level, Extracellular Vesicles for Drug Delivery, Virtual Reality Technology, Spatial Sensing Technologies for Autonomous Vehicles, Application of Machine Learning to the Personal Loan Industry in China. 
The widely varied subjects reflect the diversity of personal interests of the students!

was taught in the Winter and Spring of 2018. [Video] This course, taught in conjunction with Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center results in devices which help people with serious disabilities. By applying engineering skills and working with the people who have the actual challenge we are addressing, we have created some useful products which can change people's lives. Of the 12 devices created in the last 2 years of the course, 3 have been chosen to be presented at the National Conference of the Rehabilitation Society. This choice was made from 100 competing University submissions.

A significant accomplishment this year is the  prototyping of a device which has the attributes of a "smart cane". Testing at Rancho showed that balance can be maintained even for some stroke victims. In collaboration with Prof. Aaron Ames and his graduate student,  Maegan Tucker, we are working on the next stage of introducing this device.

It is a capstone ME course.
